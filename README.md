# Sign_language_detection
This project implements a real-time sign language detection system using computer vision techniques, primarily leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system aims to recognize and interpret hand gestures corresponding to sign language letters/words, providing an accessible tool for communication between the hearing and the deaf communities.

Sign language is a crucial mode of communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. However, understanding and translating sign language can be challenging for those who do not know it. This project uses machine learning and computer vision to create a system capable of detecting and interpreting sign language in real-time, allowing for more accessible communication.

Key Technologies
OpenCV: A powerful library for real-time computer vision.
MediaPipe: A framework for building perception pipelines, particularly useful for detecting hands, gestures, and other features.
Python: The main programming language used in this project.
Features
Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects and recognizes hand gestures in real-time.
Customizable Sign Language Dataset: Train the model on your own set of hand gestures.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for interacting with the system.
Scalable: Easily add new gestures or modify existing ones.
